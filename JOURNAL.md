## 11/10/2025 3:01 PM - Created a hockey stick 3D model  

I created a 3D model of a hockey stick for my friend's birthday. I had to do some research on the dimensions and measurements first. The time taken is quite high because I am a relative beginner to Fusion, and it takes me quite a while and a lot of trial and error to work out how to do some things.

I firstly created a cylindrical shaft for the handle by extruding a circle, and cut a coil around it for the grip marks. I filleted the ends to make it look more realistic and added a top cap.

After the handle, I created the main body of the stick. I firstly extruded the cylinder from the handle further. I then created a sketch to cut the cylinder slightly below the top, and tapered it to meet the handle, thus creating a flat surface. I did the same on the other side, but rounded the top back by extruding an arc and filleting.

I then created the hook of the stick, by sketching a spline and extruding to follow the path. This curved the hook round whilst keeping the proportions. I then filleted the end of the hook to create a smooth round cap.

I then imported it into Bambu slicer and added text with my friend's name and hockey team on it (it is a birthday present).

## 11/10/2025 3:34 PM - Created column lamp 3D model  

I am making a desk lamp shaped like an Ionic column, with a cavity inside for an LED strip, and storage space inside for paraphenalia.

I firstly sketched a circle and extruded to create a cylinder, and hollowed it out. I then added flutes by sketching and cutting one, and duplicating with the circular pattern around the whole body.

I then created the inner cylinder by extruding it, and created a base on the bottom, extruding and filleting circles to create a taper to the plinth. I added a plate to the bottom for a circuit to be affixed to, which will power the LED strip, and cut holes between the layers for the wiring.

Next, I created the capital of the column, starting with the volutes. I created these by sketching a spiral using the coil tool, and extruding to create a body. I then created a new body in a block, and cut the spiral into it to give the recess look. I then sketched curves onto it to make it look more like an authentic capital. I added walls at the bottom so it can sit on top of the column and be easily removable for storage purposes.

Finally, I created the tray for storage, by extruding a circle to form a hollow cylinder, and adding a recess in the bottom and a rod on top so they can be modular.
